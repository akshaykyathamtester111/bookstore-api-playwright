## Tech Stack

| Tool             | Purpose                            |
|------------------|------------------------------------|
| **Playwright**   | API test execution engine          |
| **TypeScript**   | Strongly-typed test scripting      |
| **FastAPI**      | Backend API under test             |
| **Node.js**      | JavaScript runtime                 |
| **Dotenv**       | Environment variable management    |
| **GitHub Actions** | CI/CD pipeline automation       |

---

## Setup & Configuration

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/bookstore-api-playwright.git
cd bookstore-api-playwright
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Configure Environment

Create a `.env` file at the root with:

```env
BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000
```

Ensure your FastAPI server is running:

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

---

## How to Run Tests

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run All Tests

```bash
npx playwright test
```

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Show HTML Report

```bash
npx playwright show-report
```

---

## Reporting

After each run, an interactive HTML report is available:

```bash
npx playwright show-report
```

The report includes:

- Total tests passed/failed/skipped
- Request/response logs
- Test duration
- Clear visibility into failing steps

---

## Test Coverage

| Operation         | Covered Scenarios                   |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **POST /books**   | Valid/Invalid Create Book           |
| **GET /books**    | List and Get Book by ID             |
| **PUT /books/{id}** | Valid/Invalid Update Book        |
| **DELETE /books/{id}** | Valid/Invalid Delete Book    |
| **Request Chaining** | Create ‚Üí Use ID in Update/Delete |
| **Validation**    | Headers, Status, Response Body      |

---

## CI/CD Integration

GitHub Actions pipeline (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) includes:

- Node setup and dependency install
- Running Playwright tests
- Report generation and upload (as artifact)

Trigger: Runs on every push to `main`.
